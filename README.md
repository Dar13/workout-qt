# workout-qt (working title)
A workout log app that has the features I want. Nothing too fancy, but different from the ones I've tried before.
The plan is to start with a desktop app to flesh out features and then port to Android, changing UI as needed.

# Building
1. Import project into Qt Creator, use Qt 5.x (not sure which I require at this point, but I'm building against 5.8+ on my machine).
2. Voila, should magically build/run!

# Feature List
* Straight-to-the-point main screen [done!]
* Easy viewing of the set log [done!]
* Ability to add/edit/delete exercises to/from app's database [done!]
* Ability to record sets that are stored in a database [done!]
* Easy export of said database to CSV or raw dump of SQLite3 database file [planned]
* Easy manipulation of log from within the app [editing done! deletion is planned]
* Basic analysis/graphs of log, delineated by exercise, date, or other criteria [planned]

# License/Copying
This is a pet project so I don't care all that much about this code, but I'm going to slap an MIT license on it.
Will consider relicensing to GPL in the future.

# Installing
No instructions yet, the app isn't even finished yet! Assumedly this will be updated when Android support is added,
but I might need to put a reminder somewhere...
